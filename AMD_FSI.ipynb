Six global variables allow the customisation of the algorithm and are passed as parameters to the constructors of these classes. Four functions (*words*, *nonStopWords*, *joinStopWords* and *kgrams*) have already been defined to compute the shingles in four different ways and another function is used to preprocess the raw data.\\\n","The dataset is organized as a Spark RDD, so its standard methods are used to apply the previously defined functions/methods to the entire dataset.
